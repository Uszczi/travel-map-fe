Cover Planner is an app for creating unique routes that cover every street in a city.
Design a page with a map:
At the top, include a header with the logo on the left, navigation links in the center, and theme, language, and login controls on the right.
Below the header, place an options panel on the left (e.g., start, end, distance, etc.), including a switch to set the end point to be the same as the start point, and the map on the right.
Below the map (or below the options panel on smaller screens), display information about the generated route and provide arrow controls to switch between route variations.
